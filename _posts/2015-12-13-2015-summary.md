In this post I summarize everything important what I have done and what happened to me in 2015.

### The birth of our son
The most important event in 2015 is naturally the birth of our son.
My wife and I carefully prepared for this brightest moment of our life.
We started reading books about children, visiting courses, buying furniture, etc. long before the due date.
As it was planned, this happened in Moscow in one of the best maternity hospitals in Russia.
All the time while my wife was giving a birth to our baby we've been together.
I’m very happy that everything went fine. Now we are trying to be the best parents we can be :)

### Moscow and Bookmate
Most of the time this year we lived in Moscow.
In my opinion it is the best city to live in Russia.
And one of the reasons for it is that there are much more career opportunities.
I worked for a company called Bookmate – a social ebook subscription service.
A company's office is located in the very center of Moscow, just 5 minutes away from the Red Square by foot.
As it is a modern tech startup inside [DI](http://icanchoose.ru/company/dream-industries/) holding, there were all kind of perks for employees: free smoothies, gourmet breakfasts, various fruits, fresh juices, vegetarian lunches, meditation and yoga exercises, table-tennis table, etc. :)
However, in my opinion, a team is the most important asset of the company.
It was a pleasure to work with such talented people.

### Vacation in Volgograd & Lake Baskunchak
For our first travel after birth of our son we decided not to go very far, as our little boy was only 3 months old.
We took a flight to Volgograd (Stalingrad in the past) – a city in the South of Russia where I finished my school and graduated from university.
We stayed there with my friend's family.
They have a daughter, she is 1.5 year older than our son.
After that we went to the Lake Baskunchak all together by car and stayed there for a week.
I have read that it is the most salty lake in the world located in a reserved zone, it is even more salty than the Dead Sea in Israel (we traveled across the whole country with my wife last year).
Medical treatments, salt, mud, fresh air, water and sun – that was everything we needed :)
Finally, we went back to Volgograd by train and spent a few days meeting with some of my relatives and exploring the city where I lived.

### Moving to Kaliningrad
At the end of the summer 2015 we decided to go to Kaliningrad.
This time our choice fell on my wife's home city – an exclave between Poland and Lithuania on the Baltic Sea.
We understood that it was a perfect moment to escape from a big city, to travel and to try something new while our son is a baby.
We took one way tickets, packed all our things and transferred them from Moscow to Kaliningrad, everything including a car.
I started working remotely as my team at Bookmate allowed me to do so.
We planned to finish all construction works in our apartment in Kaliningrad during 1 month and move therein.
Unfortunately, I underestimated 3 things: a cost of construction works, the fact that constructors usually break deadlines and it takes a lot of time even if you try to delegate everything.

### Meeting of generations
It was great that our son have had a chance to see all his grand parents this year.
During this time we have visited some interesting places in Kaliningrad, cozy cities on the shore of the Baltic Sea and enjoyed the exquisite beauty of Curonian Spit – curved sand-dune spit, a UNESCO World Heritage Site shared by Russia and Lithuania.
After living in the Russian capital it was nice to “slow down”, start spending more time with family instead of wasting time commuting.
Presently the internet gives us an opportunity to stream the brightest moments of our son’s life to our relatives.

### Books
Probably you have seen the [talk of Jack Ma](https://www.facebook.com/DrSaiSatish/videos/834355316632702) (over 11M views) – AliBaba President, one of the richest man in the world.
He advices to be a good student under 20, before 30 years old – to follow somebody, learn a passion and how to do a lot of things, from 30 to 40 years old – work for yourself, if you want to become an entrepreneur.
And for this last 2 decades I would recommend the following books. *The Defining Decade: Why Your Twenties Matter–And How to Make the Most of Them Now. Meg Jay* – it says how important to make a lot of necessary things in your twenties while it is not so late.
Don’t waste your time, as it is the most important decade in your life.
*The 4-hour workweek: escape 9–5, live anywhere, and join the new rich. Timothy Ferriss* – it shows that the real goal is not to build a “unicorn company” and to cash out through an IPO, but to create an automated vehicle for generating cash without consuming time by having mini-retirements, outsourcing your life, etc.
This book might be helpful whether you are an office plankton or a Fortune 500 CEO.
The whole list of all books I’ve read this year you can find in my previous [post](/books/2015/12/05/list-of-books-i-have-read/).

### A new country
A [quote](/books/2013/08/09/favorite-quotes/) from the book "Atlas Shrugged" comes to my mind: "He spent his childhood all over the world, because his father wanted him to know the world as his domain".
Probably, I’m trying to make this quote become true for our son.
He already traveled by train, several times by plane, by car, rode on a bicycle and even on a motorcycle before he was 6 months old.
Now we live in Cyprus.
We decided to move to a more sunny place as soon as it became cold in Russia.
We rent an apartment located 15 minutes away from the sea by foot.
I have a new job in international company.
It’s great that I can come home for lunch and spend more time with my family as the office lies just 5 minutes away by car.
A high level of safety, a good air quality, a lot of sunny days and an English friendly environment – this all makes it very comfortable to live on the island and enjoy our life.

I hope that the New Year 2016 brings us to the next level of happiness :)
